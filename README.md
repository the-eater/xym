Reimplementing [`xbps`](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps) with [`ratking`](https://github.com/the-eater/ratking-py)

# motivation

From design XBPS only allows 1 version to be available in a repository, but I have from time to time different versions of a package in my repo and the official repo of void, this causes confusion for xbps, so I want fix that by writing my own wrapper.

I also hope to make this a god package manager, e.g. mapping `python-` packages to pip instead of using the distributed binary file, this makes domain specific package manager dependencies less of a mess.
